# EcoPal
A Sustainability foccussed app with the aim of reducing the carbon footprint in the local area of Gothenburg, Sweden.


The app currently is a simple command line application built using python, which makes use of cowsay (a popular linux ascii art package) in python to generate cute ascii art graphics in the termainal.

It provides the user with motivations if they have eco friendly travel habits, otherwise giving the user advice if their current habit/ journey could have been taken another way/ form of transport, ie bike rather then car.

There is a points based system at the end of the simulated week which will show you how eco friendly you are in multiple catagories, and also give you motivations or advice based on these scores.
